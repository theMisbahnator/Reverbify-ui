## Deviations

- We did not implement all the sections of the home page as we were not able to make it dynamic to be able to find "recently" played songs.
- We did not make the homepage dynamic in the sense that it displays data retreived from the API just yet.
- We were not able to fully finish all songs page
- Constraints were not added to any of the pages, Sign up page is clear victim of this
